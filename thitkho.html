    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Delicious and classic braised pork and egg dish using <a href="caramelsauce.html">caramel sauce</a> and coco rico. Traditionally uses pork belly but I like to use pork spare ribs or pork shoulder for a less fatty version.

        <li>1-2 shallots minced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp <a href="caramelsauce.html">caramel sauce</a> plus more for the braising liquid to taste (I'd recommend another 1/2 cup)</li>
    </ul>
    In The Braise
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>1 shallot minced</li>
        <li>2-3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup coco rico</li>
        <li>8-12 hard boiled and peeled eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't already, make the <a href="caramelsauce.html">caramel sauce</a></li>
        <li>Hard boil all your eggs and peel them. I like to bring a pot with water, salt, and a little vinegar to a boil then add the eggs slowly and gently for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool them down quick before peeling.</li>
        <li>Fill up a pot of with enough water to blanch the pork and some salt.</li>
        <li>Cut pork into 2x2 inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the pork into the pot of water, bring to a boil, then drop the temperature and let simmer for 2-3 minutes while skimming the coagulated blood.</li>
        <li>Drain the pork into a colander and rinse with cold water, washing off any excess gunk.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pork into a bowl, add all the marinade ingredients, and mix well. Let marinade for 30 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Heat up over medium heat the grapseed oil in a pot that will fit all the pork and eggs.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and shallots and sweat out a few minutes making sure to not burn them.</li>
        <li>Add the pork and all of the marinade into the pot and let cook while stirring about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water and coco rico, bring up to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add some salt, pepper, and more caramel sauce to taste (remember, flavors will intensify as it braises on).</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let simmer for an hour.</li>
        <li>Check if the meat is tender, and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
    </ol>
